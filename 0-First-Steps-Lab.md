Duration: 30 minutes



##  Introduction

During this lab, we are going to set up your laptop to be prepared to all labs during this workshop. You should be able to connect to an **OpenShift** Cluster thru the Web Console and navigate thru the different kubernetes resources.

The instructor has already built a POC OpenShift Cluster for you. 



![image-20191116105934442](images/image-20191116105934442-3898374.png)



As you can see on the picture, you will connect to the OpenShift Cluster Web UI to the Master for management and development purposes. The end-users will connect to the applications thru the Infra Node.



## Task #1 - Modifying your environment

The instructor will give you some informations:

- a user ID and password to connect to the Master Node. The user ID is in the format **labuser<xx>** where xx is a number from 00 to 99. Don't use someone else userID except if the instructor ask you to do so. 
- a project name in the format **labproj<xx>**. Each project is associated to the corresponding labuser<xx>. 

The instructor will give you a specific line **similar** to this one in the following format:

```
<IP address>   <hostname>   <Fully Qualified Hostname>
```

As an example:

> 149.81.75.121   nicekm0    nicekm0.ibm.ws



Take a note of the instructor line and append this line in your **laptop /etc/hosts** file:



- [ ] For Linux and MacOS, open a terminal:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Save the file (Ctrl O, Enter, Ctrl X).



- [ ] For Windows, use notepad to edit the foolowing file:

```
c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
```

Save the file.

Do **not** reboot your laptop.



## Task #2 - Connecting to the Web Console

You can now use the following link in your preferred browser :

```http
https://<Fully Qualified Hostname>:8443
```

Please take a note of this link because we will use it very often.

You should see the following page after a few seconds:



![image-20191008154755641](images/image-20191008154755641-0542475.png)



Type your credentials (**user ID, password**) and click **Log in**

![image-20191008154849227](images/image-20191008154849227-0542529.png)



**<u>Important note</u>** : You need to modify your **/etc/hosts** and add the given line at the end of the file otherwise you will get a redirection or a page-notfound problem (404, 403 or 401). 

> Be very careful when you type the line especially on the IP address and the hostnames.

##  Task #3 - Installing the OpenShift CLI

In fact, you will need to use the **oc** command during the labs. If you need some more information during the installation, go to that link

<https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli>

This link is very practical to download both the **oc** and the associated **kubectl**.

> During the labs, you will notice that the oc command is a superset of the kubectl command. 
>
> To view a local version of the OpenShift dashboard and to deploy apps into your Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters, install the OpenShift Origin CLI (`oc`). The `oc` CLI includes a matching version of the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`). For more information, see the [OpenShift docs ![External link icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9f1f0e8497919a12c28ba837f4a351d74747fe0b/icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html).



### 1. Download the zip file corresponding to your Operating System

[Download the OpenShift Origin CLI ![External link icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9f1f0e8497919a12c28ba837f4a351d74747fe0b/icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://www.okd.io/download.html) for your local operating system and OpenShift version. The current default OpenShift version is 3.11. Choose the Operating System in the `Download oc Client Tools`



![image-20191012152427640](images/image-20191012152427640-0886667.png)

### 2. Move the binaries to the right directory

If you use **MacOS** or Linux, complete the following steps to add the binaries to your `PATH` system variable. If you use **Windows**, install the `oc` CLI in any other directory that is listed in your `PATH`  system variables. This setup saves you some file path changes when you run commands later.



1. Extract and Move the `oc` and `kubectl` executable files to the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

   ```
   mv /<filepath>/oc /usr/local/bin/oc
   mv /<filepath>/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
   ```

2. Make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is listed in your `PATH` system variable. The `PATH` variable contains all directories where your operating system can find executable files. The directories that are listed in the `PATH` variable serve different purposes. `/usr/local/bin` is used to store executable files for software that is not part of the operating system and that was manually installed by the system administrator.

   ```
   echo $PATH
   ```

   Example CLI output:

   ```
   /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
   ```



### 3. Check the OC command

Open a terminal or a command line console and type:

```shell
oc login https://<Cluster Master Hostname>:8443
```

Then enter your credentials (userID and password) as an example:

```shell
Authentication required for https://nice-cluster-3f022ac5fd-master-0.IBM-OpenShift.cloud:8443 (openshift)
Username: labuser01
Password: 
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

#
```

> **You don't need to create a new project because a new secure project space has already been created for you.** 

If you had to create a new project, you would have typed : oc new-project labproj<xx> where **xx** is your number.

To switch to your project:

``` bash
oc project labproj<XX>
```

Results as an example:

```shell
oc project labproj01
Now using project "labproj01" on server "https://nice-cluster-3f022ac5fd-master-0.IBM-OpenShift.cloud:8443".
```



To understand what project you are using:

```
oc projects
```

Results:

```shell
oc projects
You have one project on this server: "labproj01".

Using project "labproj01" on server "https://nice-cluster-3f022ac5fd-master-0.IBM-OpenShift.cloud:8443".
# 
```

In the case of using multiple projects, you can change from one project to another one, use the following command :

``` shell
oc project <another project>
```

Now you are ready to go thru the exercises. 



## Task #4 - Deploy some code

Now go back to the Web UI and deploy your first application.

From the **catalog console**, find the **Node.js** tile. 

![image-20191125170952961](images/image-20191125170952961-4698193.png)



Select **Node.js** entry:

![image-20191125171051939](images/image-20191125171051939-4698251.png)

You can have a look to the github **sample** repository. 

Click **next**.

![image-20191125171440526](images/image-20191125171440526-4698480.png)

Replace xx with your own number:

- labproj<xx> in the add to project field
- labapp<xx> in the Application name
- https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git  in the git repository where we have our code



![image-20191125171751261](images/image-20191125171751261-4698671.png)

Click **close**.

Go back to the Catalog Console and click on **view all** to select your project **labproj<xx>**.

![image-20191125172105692](images/image-20191125172105692-4698865.png)

As an example in the **application console**, you should see you application deployment **labapp<xx>**:

![image-20191125172145274](images/image-20191125172145274-4698905.png)

If you drill down, at some point you should see your pod running:

![image-20191125172400837](images/image-20191125172400837-4699040.png)

To get access to your application, you have to find the route: go to **Application** on the left pane and the choose **Route**:

![image-20191125172539655](images/image-20191125172539655-4699139.png)

Click on the hostname link and voil√† ! You get access to your application.

## Conclusion

**Congrats !**  You successfully installed and used the oc CLI and the OpenShift web console thru the installation of a typical Node.JS application (from Github). 

You noticed the following details:

- easy to install for the oc CLI
- easy to access the OpenShift web console
- easy to build and deploy a simple application with the console.
